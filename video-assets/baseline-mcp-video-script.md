### **Scene 1: The Digital Ranch**

**(0:00 - 0:25)**

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A photorealistic, cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The image captures a futuristic ranch at sunset. In the foreground, a cowboy figure (Technickel) with a sunglasses emoji for a face stands confidently with hands on hips. He is in front of a glowing, high-tech fence. Behind the fence, a herd of holographic, wireframe cattle graze in a field. The mood is a cool, confident blend of classic western and high-tech.",
> **Scene Description:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic, 16:9 aspect ratio shot of a futuristic ranch at sunset. The lighting is cinematic and warm. In the foreground, TECHNICKEL, an AI Wrangler, stands with hands on hips, exuding confidence. He's dressed in classic cowboy attire (hat, vest, red bandana), but his face is a sunglasses emoji. He is in front of a fence made of glowing light beams. In the background, a herd of holographic, wireframe cattle graze peacefully.",
> **Action:** "Technickel gives a wave. The holographic cattle in the background flicker slightly.",
> **Audio - Music:** "A cinematic western guitar melody fused with a subtle, pulsing electronic beat, with an optimistic, morning feel.",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "The gentle sounds of a ranch waking up (distant robotic cattle lowing) mixed with a soft electronic hum."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover, calm and confident):**
Howdy. I'm Technickel, an AI Wrangler. Out here on the digital ranch, new trails are blazed every day. But this ain't no lawless land. Thankfully, a set of rules are bringing order. They call it Baseline.

### **Scene 2: The Feature Stampede**

**(0:25 - 1:00)**

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A single, photorealistic, cinematic still image in a 16:9 aspect ratio, capturing a moment of chaos. A developer in a hoodie with a frustrated emoji for a face recoils from their computer monitor, out of which a stampede of highly-detailed, robotic cattle is bursting forth in a blur of motion. The lighting is dramatic, coming from the screen. The mood is stressful and overwhelming.",
> **Scene Description:** "A photorealistic and cinematic shot of a developer at a desk in a dimly lit room. The developer wears a black hoodie, and their face is a neutral emoji (😐). The aspect ratio is 16:9. The screen, filled with browser compatibility tables, glows brightly.",
> **Action:** "The emoji face is neutral (😐). Suddenly, the tables burst from the screen in a chaotic explosion, transforming into a highly detailed stampede of wild, robotic cattle. The developer throws their hands up, and the camera zooms in on their face as the emoji changes to one of frustration and stress (😫).",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "The thunderous sound of a cattle stampede mixed with chaotic computer error noises."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
For ages, developers have been stuck in a browser compatibility showdown. "Which features are safe to build with? Which ones will work for all your users?" Answering those questions has been like trying to nail a tumbleweed to a post.

Now, Baseline's the sheriff 'round these parts that settles those arguments, giving us a clear signal on what's good to go. But what developer has the time to constantly check that data?

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A single, photorealistic, cinematic still image in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A developer's emoji face is in the foreground, displaying a happy, relieved expression (😊). Over their shoulder, a crisp, futuristic command-line interface is visible, showing a clean status report with green checkmarks. In the background, the previously chaotic robotic longhorns are now standing in a perfectly orderly line. The mood is calm and satisfying.",
> **Scene Description:** "A clean, futuristic command-line interface materializes in a 16:9 aspect ratio, stable shot. The text is crisp and vibrant. A single command is typed: `mcp get-status`. The background shows the blurred, chaotic stampede from the previous shot.",
> **Action:** "The stampeding longhorns instantly freeze and arrange themselves into a single, orderly line. A simple, clear status report appears on the screen. The developer from before now looks relieved, their emoji face changing to a happy, satisfied expression (😊).",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "The chaotic noise abruptly stops, replaced by a satisfying 'cha-ching' sound and the gentle hum of a well-oiled machine."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
That's where my project, Baseline MCP server, comes in.

Now, having the Baseline data is like having a good map of the lands. That's useful, for sure. But a map is just paper. It can't answer your questions.

**(Visuals:** {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A photorealistic, cinematic still photo of a complex 3D animation in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A photorealistic, glowing glass brain is the central focus, suspended in a clean, white space. Tool icons (a magnifying glass, a scale, a lasso) made of glowing light are seen flying into the brain. The mood is transformative and intelligent.",
> **Scene Description:** "A photorealistic CGI animated sequence in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A complex, glowing glass brain floats in a clean, white space. Tool icons representing 'query,' 'compare,' and 'analyze' (like a magnifying glass, a scale, and a lasso) fly into the brain with energetic motion lines.",
> **Action:** "As each tool icon is absorbed, the brain glows more intensely, signifying its new capabilities."
> })

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
My server uses the Model-Context Protocol - MCP for short. The protocol turns that static map into a live expert you can talk to. It gives the AI a set of tools - not just to read the data, but to actively *work* with it.

So instead of just looking at the map, you're asking your guide, "What's the quickest route?" or "Is it safe to cross that river?"

This is what connects you to the *meaning* in the Baseline context, giving you the straight-up truth to end decision fatigue for good.

### **Scene 3: Hold Your Horses!**

**(1:00 - 1:15)**

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A single, photorealistic, cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A gloved hand dramatically stops a futuristic, holographic record player that's spinning an old-timey vinyl record. The lighting is dramatic. The mood is commanding and direct.",
> **Scene Description:** "An extreme close-up on a futuristic, holographic record player in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The shot is photorealistic and highly detailed. An old-timey vinyl record is spinning on it.",
> **Action:** "A leather-gloved hand enters the frame and dramatically stops the record, causing the music to scratch to a halt. The holographic elements of the record player flicker and die down.",
> **Audio - Music:** "The music comes to a sudden, scratching halt, like a record scratch."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
Now, hold your horses. It's easy to think you've seen this show before; another so-called Baseline MCP. But most of the herd are just simple data wrappers. This ol' server is a different breed entirely, and it's got a few (or over 30) tricks up its sleeve.

### **Scene 4: The Wrangler's Toolkit**

**(1:15 - 2:30)**

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
The MCP server comes equipped with a unique set of tools for some real sharpshootin'.

**Visuals - Example 1: The Study Guide**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A photorealistic, cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio with dramatic lighting. A robotic hand is writing on a futuristic, glowing tablet. The tablet displays a beautifully formatted study guide with charts and code examples. The mood is educational and high-tech.",
> **Scene Description:** "A crisp, high-resolution screen recording of a terminal in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The text is perfectly clear and has a modern, slightly glowing font.",
> **Action:** "The command `mcp create-study-guide` is run. The terminal shows a progress bar, and then a message 'Study guide created at study-guide.md'. A file explorer window opens, showing the newly created file.",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "A futuristic 'writing' sound effect."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
The power of Baseline is knowing what's safe to build with *right now*. The Study Guide prompt is a perfect example of turning that knowledge into action. It doesn't just show you a list of features; it curates the most important ones - the brand new and the newly stable - so you can stay on the cutting edge without risking a broken user experience.

**Visuals - Example 2**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A photorealistic, cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A futuristic code editor is shown with a file open. A glowing magnifying glass is scanning the code, highlighting web features. The mood is analytical and high-tech.",
> **Scene Description:** "A crisp, high-resolution screen recording of a terminal in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The text is perfectly clear and has a modern, slightly glowing font.",
> **Action:** "The command `mcp find-features-in-file --filePath 'example'` is run. The terminal outputs a list of web features found in the file. Then, the command `mcp min-browser-support-report --filePath 'example'` is run. A beautiful markdown report is generated and displayed, showing the minimum browser versions required for the features in the file.",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "A futuristic 'scanning' sound effect, followed by a 'report generated' sound."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
It's one thing to know what's possible, but it's another to know what's in your own codebase. Point the tool at any file or directory to see how your existing projects measure up against Baseline. You can't know if you're quick on the draw or a step behind if you don't know where you stand. And by going further with a browser support report, you can get a clear picture of your project's compatibility, and make sure you're not leaving any users in the dust.

**Visuals - Example 3**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A photorealistic, cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A futuristic, holographic map is being projected from a device. The map shows different paths and points of interest, with one path being highlighted. The mood is adventurous and futuristic.",
> **Scene Description:** "A crisp, high-resolution screen recording of a terminal in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The text is perfectly clear and has a modern, slightly glowing font.",
> **Action:** "The command `mcp suggest-baseline-features --goal 'I want to take my family photo album and make it a mosaic'` is run. The terminal outputs a suggestion for using 'Grid', with links to the specifications and a brief explanation of each.",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "A futuristic 'suggestion' sound effect, like a gentle chime."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
But what if you don't know what you're looking for? You don't even need to know the name of the feature. Just describe your goal, and the MCP will suggest the right baseline features for the job. It's like having a wise old prospector who knows where to find the mother lode, pointing you to the richest veins of the web platform.

### **Scene 5: Ride into the Sunset**

**(2:30 - 3:00)**

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A beautiful, and highly-detailed photorealistic cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A cowboy figure (Technickel, with his emoji face showing a content smile (😊)) is riding a magnificent cyan wireframe holographic horse. They are captured mid-gallop, heading away from the camera towards a dramatic binary sunset over a digital ranch. The lighting is warm and cinematic. The mood is hopeful, conclusive, and epic.",
> **Scene Description:** "A beautiful, highly detailed, photorealistic shot in a 16:9 aspect ratio. Technickel, an AI Wrangler, is back on the digital ranch, with cinematic sunset lighting. He's riding the magnificent cyan wireframe holographic horse.",
> **Action:** "He rides slowly towards a binary sunset. As he gets smaller, he turns back slightly, and his emoji face gives a final, friendly smiling expression (😊) before he faces forward again. The sun dips below the horizon, and the entire screen quickly fades to black.",
> **Audio - Music:** "The main theme swells to a heroic, optimistic crescendo, then fades out with the screen."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
In the end, it's about building better, faster, and with more confidence. We all know AI agents are the next frontier in developer tooling, but an agent without the right context is like a rider without a horse. Equipping them for the job is paramount. Baseline MCP isn't just another tool; it's the saddle and spurs for this new breed of AI. This is how we blaze the trail forward, delivering the innovation and usefulness every developer is looking for.

**Final Screen:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A clean, minimalist, high-resolution screen capture in a 16:9 aspect ratio. On a solid black background, the words 'Baseline MCP' are displayed in the center in a crisp, modern, white font. Below it, the hackathon URL is visible in a slightly smaller font. The image is perfectly balanced and easy to read.",
> **Scene Description:** "A black screen in a 16:9 aspect ratio.",
> **Action:** "After a moment of silence, the 'Baseline MCP' logo fades in, clean and centered. A moment later, the hackathon URL appears below it in a crisp, modern, white font."
> }
