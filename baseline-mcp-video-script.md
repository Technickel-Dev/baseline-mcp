### **Scene 1: The Digital Ranch**

**(0:00 - 0:25)**

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A single, ultra-detailed, photorealistic cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The image captures a wide, cinematic panorama of a futuristic ranch at dawn. In the foreground, a cowboy figure (Technickel) leans against a fence made of glowing light beams. He's dressed in classic western attire, but his face is a black mask with a simple, friendly emoji LED smile ('^_^'). The mood is peaceful, optimistic, and high-tech.",
> **Scene Description:** "A highly detailed, photorealistic, 16:9 aspect ratio sweeping shot across a sprawling ranch at dawn. The lighting is cinematic and warm. In the foreground, TECHNICKEL, an AI Wrangler, leans against a light-fence post. He's dressed in classic cowboy attire (duster coat, boots, cowboy hat). His face is completely obscured by a black mask with a vibrant, friendly emoji LED smile ('^_^').",
> **Action:** "Technickel pushes off the post, walks towards the camera with a confident stride. His LED mask gives a subtle, friendly blink. He tips his hat.",
> **Audio - Music:** "A cinematic western guitar melody fused with a subtle, pulsing electronic beat, with an optimistic, morning feel.",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "The gentle sounds of a ranch waking up (distant robotic cattle lowing) mixed with a soft electronic hum."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover, calm and confident):**
Howdy. I'm Technickel, an AI Wrangler. Out here on the digital ranch, things move fast. New trails are blazed every day. But this ain't a lawless land. Thankfully, a set of rules is bringing order to the chaos. They call it Baseline.

### **Scene 2: The Feature Stampede**

**(0:25 - 1:00)**

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A single, photorealistic, cinematic still image in a 16:9 aspect ratio, capturing a moment of chaos. A developer in a hoodie wears a black LED mask displaying a glitching, frustrated expression ('>_<'). They are recoiling from their computer monitor, out of which a stampede of highly-detailed, robotic longhorns is bursting forth in a blur of motion. The lighting is dramatic, coming from the screen. The mood is stressful and overwhelming.",
> **Scene Description:** "A photorealistic and cinematic shot of a developer at a desk in a dimly lit room. The developer wears a black hoodie and a simple black mask that covers their entire face. The front of the mask is a vibrant LED display. The aspect ratio is 16:9. The screen, filled with browser compatibility tables, glows brightly.",
> **Action:** "The LED mask displays a simple, neutral expression (e.g., '•_•'). Suddenly, the tables burst from the screen in a chaotic explosion, transforming into a highly detailed stampede of wild, robotic longhorns. The developer throws their hands up, and the camera zooms in on their mask as the LED expression changes to one of frustration and stress (e.g., '>_<', or frantic, glitching lines).",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "The thunderous sound of a cattle stampede mixed with chaotic computer error noises."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
For ages, developers have been stuck in a browser compatibility showdown. "Which features are safe to build with? Which ones will work for all your users?" Answering those questions has been like trying to nail a tumbleweed to a post.

Now, Baseline is the sheriff 'round these parts that settles those arguments, giving us a clear signal on what's good to go. But a developer's work is never done. Who has the time to constantly check that data?

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A single, photorealistic, cinematic still image in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A developer's LED mask is in the foreground, displaying a happy, relieved expression ('^_^'). Over their shoulder, a crisp, futuristic command-line interface is visible, showing a clean status report with green checkmarks. In the background, the previously chaotic robotic longhorns are now standing in a perfectly orderly line. The mood is calm and satisfying.",
> **Scene Description:** "A clean, futuristic command-line interface materializes in a 16:9 aspect ratio, stable shot. The text is crisp and vibrant. A single command is typed: `mcp get-status`. The background shows the blurred, chaotic stampede from the previous shot.",
> **Action:** "The stampeding longhorns instantly freeze and arrange themselves into a single, orderly line. A simple, clear status report appears on the screen. The developer from before now looks relieved, their LED mask changing to a happy, satisfied expression (e.g., '^_^' or a simple smiling curve).",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "The chaotic noise abruptly stops, replaced by a satisfying 'cha-ching' sound and the gentle hum of a well-oiled machine."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
That's where my project, the Baseline MCP server, comes in.

Now, having the Baseline data is like having a good map of the territory. That's useful, for sure. But a map is just paper. It can't answer your questions.

**(Visuals:** {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A photorealistic, cinematic still photo of a complex 3D animation in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A photorealistic, glowing glass brain is the central focus, suspended in a clean, white space. Tool icons (a magnifying glass, a scale, a lasso) made of glowing light are seen flying into the brain. The mood is transformative and intelligent.",
> **Scene Description:** "A photorealistic CGI animated sequence in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A complex, glowing glass brain floats in a clean, white space. Tool icons representing 'query,' 'compare,' and 'analyze' (like a magnifying glass, a scale, and a lasso) fly into the brain with energetic motion lines.",
> **Action:** "As each tool icon is absorbed, the brain glows more intensely, signifying its new capabilities."
> })

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
My server uses the Model-Context Protocol—MCP for short. The protocol turns that static map into a live expert you can talk to. It gives the AI a set of tools—not just to read the data, but to actively *work* with it. To query it, to compare it, to analyze it for you.

So instead of just looking at the map, you're asking your guide, "What's the quickest route?" or "Is it safe to cross that river?" You get answers, not just data points.

This is what connects you to the *meaning* in the Baseline context, giving you the straight-up truth to cut through the noise and end decision fatigue for good.

### **Scene 3: Hold Your Horses!**

**(1:00 - 1:15)**

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A single, photorealistic, cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio. An extreme close-up on a cowboy hat and the black LED mask underneath it. The mask's expression is a simple, friendly smile ('^_^'). One hand, wearing a leather glove, is raised in a 'stop' gesture in front of the mask. The lighting is dramatic. The mood is commanding and direct.",
> **Scene Description:** "An extreme close-up on Technickel's masked face in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The shot is photorealistic and highly detailed. His LED mask is showing a simple friendly smile ('^_^').",
> **Action:** "He raises a leather-gloved hand in a 'stop' gesture. The LED smile on his mask flattens to a neutral line ('—_—') as if focusing. He looks directly into the camera.",
> **Audio - Music:** "The music comes to a sudden, scratching halt, like a record scratch."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
Now, hold your horses. It's easy to think you've seen this show before; another so-called Baseline MCP. But most of the herd are just simple data wrappers. This ol' server is a different breed entirely, and it's got a few tricks up its sleeve.

### **Scene 4: The Wrangler's Toolkit**

**(1:15 - 2:30)**

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
The MCP server comes equipped with a unique set of tools for some real sharpshootin'.

**Visuals - Example 1: The Feature Scout**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A photorealistic, cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio with dramatic lighting. Two photorealistic, detailed robotic cowboys are frozen in a classic western standoff. One robot, labeled 'Browser A,' has a green checkmark glowing on its chest. The other, 'Browser B,' has a red X. They are on a dusty digital plain under a binary sunset. The mood is competitive and high-tech.",
> **Scene Description:** "A crisp, high-resolution screen recording of a terminal in a 16:9 aspect ratio. The text is perfectly clear and has a modern, slightly glowing font.",
> **Action:** "The command `mcp feature --details \"CSS Nesting\" --compare \"Chrome,Safari\"` is run. The terminal outputs a slick, color-coded report showing exactly when CSS Nesting landed in each browser and its current Baseline status.",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "A futuristic 'scanner' sound effect."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
With the **Feature Scout**, you can get more than just a "yes" or "no." You can pull detailed histories and side-by-side comparisons for any feature across browsers.

**Visuals - Example 2: The Browser Showdown**
> {
> **Scene Description:** "A photorealistic CGI animation in a 16:9 aspect ratio with cinematic lighting. Two highly detailed, robotic cowboys face off in a classic western standoff on a dusty digital plain. One is clearly labeled 'Browser A,' the other 'Browser B.'",
> **Action:** "A list of features appears between them. As the MCP's `browser.js` tool is mentioned, one cowboy's list gets all green checkmarks, and it tips its hat.",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "A classic western duel whistle."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
Use the **Browser Tool** to script a showdown. See which of your target browsers has the best support for a whole list of modern features you want to use.

**Visuals - Example 3: The Text Lasso**
> {
> **Scene Description:** "A photorealistic CGI animation in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A swirling vortex of code, documentation, and blog posts fills the screen.",
> **Action:** "A glowing, energetic lasso flies out from the foreground and neatly ropes the entire vortex with a satisfying snap. The lasso pulls the text into the MCP server, which then spits out a single, clean 'Project Compatibility Report,' identifying every web feature mentioned and checking it against Baseline.",
> **Audio - Soundscape:** "A 'whoosh' followed by a magical 'shimmer' sound."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
And with the **Text Lasso**, you can analyze your entire codebase, or even a bunch of articles, to automatically generate a full report on what's Baseline-ready and what ain't. It's all powered by the tools in this MCP.

### **Scene 5: Ride into the Sunset**

**(2:30 - 3:00)**

**Visuals:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A beautiful, and highly-detailed photorealistic cinematic still photo in a 16:9 aspect ratio. A cowboy figure (Technickel, with his LED mask showing a content smile ('^_^')) is riding a magnificent robotic horse made of chrome and glowing light pipes. They are captured mid-gallop, heading away from the camera towards a dramatic binary sunset over a digital ranch. The lighting is warm and cinematic. The mood is hopeful, conclusive, and epic.",
> **Scene Description:** "A beautiful, highly detailed, photorealistic shot in a 16:9 aspect ratio. Technickel, an AI Wrangler, is back on the digital ranch, with cinematic sunset lighting. He's riding the magnificent robotic horse.",
> **Action:** "He rides slowly towards a binary sunset. As he gets smaller, he turns back slightly, and his LED mask gives a final, friendly smiling expression ('^_^') before he faces forward again. The sun dips below the horizon, and the entire screen quickly fades to black.",
> **Audio - Music:** "The main theme swells to a heroic, optimistic crescendo, then fades out with the screen."
> }

**Technickel (Voiceover):**
In the end, it's about building better, faster, and with more confidence. We all know AI agents are the next frontier in developer tooling, but an agent without the right context is like a rider without a horse. Equipping them for the job is paramount. Baseline MCP isn't just another tool; it's the saddle and spurs for this new breed of AI. This is how we blaze the trail forward, delivering the innovation and usefulness every developer is looking for.

**Final Screen:**
> {
> **Storyboard Prompt:** "A clean, minimalist, high-resolution screen capture in a 16:9 aspect ratio. On a solid black background, the words 'Baseline MCP' are displayed in the center in a crisp, modern, white font. Below it, the hackathon URL is visible in a slightly smaller font. The image is perfectly balanced and easy to read.",
> **Scene Description:** "A black screen in a 16:9 aspect ratio.",
> **Action:** "After a moment of silence, the 'Baseline MCP' logo fades in, clean and centered. A moment later, the hackathon URL appears below it in a crisp, modern, white font."
> }
